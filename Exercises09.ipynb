Curve Fitting: The $M_\\mathrm{BH}-\\sigma_*$ Relation\n","**`Carroll and Ostlie (2017). Section 25.2`**\n","\n","In 2006, Greene and Ho studied the characteristics of 88 galaxies to show that there is an apparent relationship between the stellar velocity dispersion $\\sigma_*$ in a galaxy bulge and the mass $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ of the supermassive black hole at its\n","center, as shown in the Figure below.

Include the errors in $\\log_\\mathrm{10} \\sigma_*$ and $\\log_\\mathrm{10} M_\\mathrm{BH}$ in your fit (make sure that the errors are defined properly!).
